# Things you should know
*This port is in development by 2 people. Don't expect us to make progress quickly. We have lives and we can't just work on this 24/7. We are teenagers and we have very important stuff such as school and jobs.*

*Do not expect this to have perfect code, optimization, etc. This is just a project that we thought would be fun.*

# VS Impostor: Codename Engine Port
An unoffical VS Impostor codename engine port! (W.I.P)

This port is focused on optimization so that even low-end pc gamers can enjoy this mod, and we also added back some scrapped songs like the Monochrome cover!

There is also a little bundle included, which is the fanmade mod, D'lowing Remix mod!

There are a LOT of new options added in this port, which has things such as underlays, hitsounds, and even a vertical healthbar! You can now play the mod in any style you want!

We also plan to add multiple languages to this! We currently plan adding:
- English (United Kingdom)
- Spanish
- French (Both France and Canadian)
- German
- Portuguese (Both Portugal and Brazil)
- Arabic (W.I.P, BEING TRANSLATED BY MAZ)
- Japanese
- And (maybe) more to come!

# Info
You need [Codename Engine](https://github.com/FNF-CNE-Devs/CodenameEngine) to play this. (duh)

And you *might* need the latest commit build as well

Due to the engine having some limits, and the fact that it is still in development, it's possible that i cant port everything in. So dont have high hopes of your favorite thing in the port!
