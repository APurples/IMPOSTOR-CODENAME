# VS Impostor: Codename Engine Port
An unoffical VS Impostor codename engine port! (W.I.P)

Also includes the D'lowing mod!

Currently being developed by one person, which is [APurples!](https://twitter.com/fake_apurples)

You need [Codename Engine](https://github.com/FNF-CNE-Devs/CodenameEngine) to play this. (duh)

And you *might* need the latest commit build as well

Due to the engine having some limits, and the fact that it is still in development, it's possible that i cant port everything in. So dont have high hopes of your favorite thing in the port!

Also big credits to [Clowfoe](https://twitter.com/clowfoe) and his team Impostorm for making VS Impostor!
Same goes to Denasu for his d'lowing remix mod!
